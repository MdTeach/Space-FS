### Implementation:

Building such platform in the Web3 enables us to add the incentives mechanism to both parties specially for the independent artist. When an artist hosts the events and supporters joins the game theroy can be:

**a) Artist**<br>
They reach out wide audience round the globe & option to get paid by the supporters joining the room from ticket sales.

**b) Supporter**<br>
For suppores we can add reward system based on NFT. for example: a supporter attending 5 events gets a certain NFT that allows him to have:

 <li>Discounts for upcomming events</li> 
 <li>Special spot on the events</li> 
 <li>The NFT can be also be sold</li>
