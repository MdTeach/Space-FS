<hr/>

### Inspiration:

In 2020/2021 we have seen rise of auido only social platfrom like Clubhouse, Twitter Space, Spotify Greeroom,etc.
In addition, platforms like https://www.gather.town/ & https://hello.vrchat.com/ reshapes how people can gather online. Idea of Space-FS is to make similar platform for atrist to host **gather.town** like audio events. Gather meetup looks like:

<div style="text-align:center">

<br>( idea is to make event gathering like <b>gather.town</b> as shown above )<br><br>
</div>

### Implementation:

Upon Building such platform in the Web3 enables us to add the incentives mechanism to both parties specially for the independent artist. When an artist hosts the events and supporters joins it the game theroy can be developed as:

**a) Artist**<br>
They can reach out to wide audience round the globe & option to get paid by the supporters joining the room from the NFT ticket sales.

**b) Supporter**<br>
For supporters we can add reward system based on NFT. for example: a supporter attending 5 events gets a certain NFT that allows him to have:

 <li>Discounts for upcomming events</li> 
 <li>Special spots on the events</li> 
 <li>The NFT can be also be sold later</li>
 <li>many more economic models can be adopted here</li>
